"This is a really neat concept, but just doesn't quite do what i want it to. I don't know if you've ever played computercraft, but something like the CraftOS found in that mod is more what im searching for. Specifically the ability to run user created program files written with real programming languages from the shell would be most desirable, but i also like the startup file, the fact that it has a myriad of APIs relevant to the hardware its on etc etc If that sort of functionality exists in t-ui then i just cant figure it out.

"Very nice Lots of features and settings, marking down because interface is a bit chunky for my liking, Chrominance noise is way too high in low light unless you use the night mode (which is actually very good), but this takes too long to process, and does so in the foreground.

"Works well enough in my opinion for team messaging, but as others note it is simply a wrapper for the web interface and thus it really is just a reference implementation. I would really like to see someone work on a native app to replace it. It's not so unresponsive as to be impractical, but just slow enough to be occasionally annoying (on a Nexus 5). One specific beef I have is with the emoji. The interface for inserting emoji is the same type-colon-to-see-context-menu approach, which is extremely unwieldy on a smartphone where depending on the input method used, the colon is a lower priority character and is often buried several clicks away. Emoji on smartphones need to be much more accessible. The whole point of emoji is to alleviate text entry through the cumbersome smartphone interface, not exacerbate it. So whoever implements a native Mattermost app, I hope they just copy the standard one-click emoji menu used by every other chat client on the planet ;) This is true for all Mattermost clients though. The system still pretty much requires you to know the text name of an emoji to find it, which is a weakness with the program. Certainly not game breaking, but an annoyance.

"With all the other EFB apps written for Apple only it is such a relief to find something written for Android. What's even better is it is free. I have a Garmin Glo that works just fine with this using the app add on for Bluetooth connectivity, Avare Bluetooth, on a Samsung Galaxy Note4 and it works just great. The added 3D properties for the map is great but I have to figure out if it will be useful for my flying profile. Thanks for building a great Aviation inspired application.

"Well, it works. Also, the seamless file browse and transfer is nice. However, this app has the potential to be GREAT. When working, seamlessly forward major phone functions to your desktop/laptop and keep working on one device only. Here are a few issues: 1. Needs ubiquitous connectivity - Bluetooth and USB should also work aside from WIFI. Also, keep in mind that the phone is not always allowed to connect to the office network and creating an ad-hoc WIFI network between the laptop and phone just for this is a waste of battery. In such cases, it might be better to have the phone wait for the laptop to reach it (firewalls..) - might even require an intermediate site.. 2. I see this app has a plugin architecture. Good. Need more functions: - access phone - send/receive calls/sms from laptop, see call/sms logs - access contacts - view, add/remove/update (as a generic phone proxy, don't assume Android and Google accounts!) - project phone screen - have the phone screen presented in the laptop display, and manipulated via the mouse (as close to gestures as possible) Overall, great start!

I use it as a multi-tool, not only for keeping track of copied text, and edited versions of posts as I bring them together, but I‘ll work directly in Clip Stack like a note pad, and organize references, notes, thoughts, even journal!

This version, on the other hand, offers plenty of settings, such as timed games, online play, a simple computer opponent, and a board size anywhere from 4 by 4 to 30 by 30, and it's free to boot.

"Better than the interpreters I've used so far. As with the other two interpreters I've tried with my Android tablet, I used Anchorhead as a benchmark. My first impression is a very favorable one! I like that it connects to IFDB and grabs images for games it recognizes, and that it looks for new games that you had downloaded every time you launch this app. Another big deal is that the Enter key does not double-echo, unlike with the other interpreters I used before. There's just one bug I've encountered. There are two places in Anchorhead where the Inform menu is put to use. The first time you activate a menu is fine, but if you activate the same menu a second time, the list does not populate. All said, I love this app, and I'll probably continue to use it until I get around to playing something where the menu bug becomes a deal-breaker. By then, there might be a bugfix release, so that might not be necessary.

Unrelated, I know, but perhaps something someone else may enjoy as well. Plus, the dev is awesome. I emailed him with a request which he replied within an hour or so.

"Very good - and could be better; 4 3/4 stars. This does exactly what it's supposed to do - tells you where you are, where you're going, approximate altitude and all the other good stuff. I've used it in light aircraft and as a passenger on commercial jet flights and it works wonderfully. A couple of things could be better: *** Storage - Avare downloads and stores a lot of map data, and getting an Android phone to store that on the SD card rather than the phone's memory is a chore. I've done this on four devices and it's been manual every time. Create a directory on the SD card, then point Avare to store maps there. Then curse when it doesn't work the first time. With maps.me doing it at the push of a button, I'd wholeheartedly advocate this as an upgrade. Heck, I'd PAY for it - if it saved me an hour's fussing it'd be worth every penny. Just sayin' ****Flight planning. Not as intuitive as you might imagine - again it takes fussing. Since I most often use the app as a reference (""where the heck am I"") rather than as a guidance method, this isn't such a problem for me but I've heard complaints about it. Again GREAT app - could be greater still.

"Good solid app Syncs well across Dropbox which allows me to download my bank data each month and work it up on the laptop then view all the reports on my phone and tablet. Nice improvements would be AES 256 encryption and making the graphs and pie charts prettier, but all in all it's a great app and works well.

"Galaxy Nexus is an unlocked GSM phone ICS 4.04 Great price on Nexus at Google Play. I just bought at Google Play. The Galaxy Nexus is an unlocked GSM phone with ICS 4.04 and sipdroid works perfect. Make sure you load gmail account right after start up, Also after that make sure you load the Voice App. and then you can download Sipdroid. and a link on the bottom of sip says new pbx or pbxes account. You must click on that so it is automatic set up. Sipdriod works Perfect. You must have a Gmail email and add Google talk Mail and Voice. And you get the free calls off WiFi for sure. I dont know yet if it works off 3g yet. I will be testing it on 3G and data usage. Hope this helps.

"Love it Love what you guys are doing. This app has grown tremendously in the last year. Having said that, the biggest problem I have with the app is the way it draws the charts. Quickly moving from one area to another while simultaneously zooming in or out causes the map to pick a completely random point to focus on. Get this fixed and the map side of things will rival ForeFlight.
