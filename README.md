# **Software Engineering for Data Science (DSCI-644) Project in Microsoft Azure**

## **Project Objective** 
The goal of this project is to re-design and re-train the model to give better performance.

**Model:** The initial model used a neural network that would give about 60% accuracy based on the reviews. The dataset was split and 75% of the dataset was used for training and 25% was used for testing.

**Architecture** contains the proposed model for the client in Microsoft Azure

**Feature Analysis** contains different models implemented on Python

**ClientApp** contains a Python implementation for an application that allows a user to enter a review as user input to the azure model which will predict whether that review is Positive or Negative.
